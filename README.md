# KOHEN

`Kohen` is a Kubernetes-native configuration management tool that allows
applications consume configuration from dedicated `git` repository and consistently update after any change.

`Kohen` is not an alternative to GitOps solutions. It adds additional capabilities for the applications that prefer running against a dedicated configuration repository that covers multiple environments.
